# Daysquare

An elegant calendar control for iOS.

## Introduction

Get bored with native silly **UIDatePicker**? You may have a try on this control. Instead of showing you an awkward wheel, it just presents as a intuitive full-size calendar with a lot of preference properties that you can change.

## Features
* Highly customizable.
* Navigating between arbitrary dates.
* Automatically adjust view to fit variety sizes.

## Guide
Try the demo project, it's very easy to use. Daysquare follows the **target-action** pattern, just like the native `UIDatePicker` class.

> **PAY ATTENTION**
> <br>
> After changing any appearance property, you have the responsibility to call `reloadViewAnimated:` method to update the view.

Enjoy it!!
